This enhancement provides detailed error reporting and debugging information when screenshot generation fails.\r\n\r\nProblem\r\n\r\nCurrently, when screenshot generation fails during site deployment:\r\n- Users see generic \"Preview not available\" with no explanation\r\n- Developers have no visibility into why screenshots are failing  \r\n- Error information is minimal and hard to debug\r\n- No tracking of screenshot failure status\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the error handling by:\r\n\r\n1. Detailed Error Logging: Captures exact error messages, file locations, and line numbers\r\n2. Screenshot Status Tracking: Adds `screenshotStatus`, `screenshotError`, and `screenshotErrorTime` attributes to deployment documents\r\n3. Enhanced Platform Logging: Adds screenshot errors to platform logs for better debugging\r\n4. Better User Feedback: Shows specific error messages in build logs instead of generic failures\r\n5. Backward Compatibility: No breaking changes - deployments continue even if screenshots fail\r\n\r\nChanges Made\r\n\r\n- Enhanced catch block in `Builds.php` with detailed error reporting\r\n- Added deployment attributes to track screenshot failure status\r\n- Improved console logging with specific error details\r\n- Fixed syntax error in existing catch block structure\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n\r\nThe changes are safe and:\r\n- ✅ Do not break existing functionality\r\n- ✅ Add better error visibility for developers\r\n- ✅ Help debug screenshot generation issues\r\n- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility\r\n- ✅ Provide meaningful error messages\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "This enhancement adds the ability to forward client IP addresses when using server-side rendering frameworks like Next.js or SvelteKit. The implementation follows the same security pattern as the existing x-forwarded-user-agent feature.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Added getIP() method override in Request class to support x-forwarded-for header\r\n- Method only trusts forwarded IP when authenticated with API key (App User)\r\n- Properly handles multiple IPs in x-forwarded-for header (uses first/original client IP)\r\n- Added comprehensive test coverage in AccountCustomClientTest\r\n\r\nThis resolves the issue where server IP addresses were logged instead of actual client IPs in SSR authentication flows, which affected rate limiting, abuse detection, and security audit logs.\r\n\r\nFixes #10788\r\n\r\n🤖 Generated by: Alex Freeman <alex@cyberitex.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!

Authorization parameter is `client_key` not `client_id`\n2. Scopes use comma separator not space: `\\implode(',', $this->getScopes())`\n\nUser info API returns nested structure: `$result['data']['user']`\n\n## Example usage\n\n```php\n$tiktok = new \\Appwrite\\Auth\\OAuth2\\TikTok($appID, $appSecret, $callback, $state);\n$loginUrl = $tiktok->getLoginURL();\n// https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/?client_key=...&scope=user.info.basic&...\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses (expand for details)</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> -

Many Ubuntu users struggle with Docker installation before they can start using Appwrite, so this addition provides clear, step-by-step instructions.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Type of Change\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation improvement\r\n- [x] Bug fix\r\n- [ ] New feature\r\n- [ ] Breaking change\r\n\r\n## ✨ Changes Made\r\n\r\n- Added comprehensive Ubuntu Docker installation guide\r\n- Included commands for adding user to docker group (to avoid sudo)\r\n- Added Docker verification step\r\n- Included important note about group changes requiring logout\r\n\r\n## 🧪 Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] Tested all commands on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\r\n- [x] Verified Docker installs correctly using these steps\r\n- [x] Confirmed all commands follow official Docker documentation\r\n- [x] Checked markdown formatting and syntax\r\n\r\n## 📸 Screenshots\r\n\r\nN/A - Documentation only\r\n\r\n## ✅ Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] My changes follow the project's style guidelines\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my changes\r\n- [x] I have tested the documentation steps\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [x] The documentation is clear and beginner-friendly\r\n\r\n## 🔗 Related Issues\r\n\r\nThis helps Ubuntu users who need Docker prerequisites before installing Appwrite.\r\n\r\n## 📚 Additional Context\r\n\r\nThese instructions are based on Docker's official Ubuntu installation guide and have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. They should work on Ubuntu 20.04+ versions. This will save Ubuntu users time by providing all necessary prerequisites in one place, rather than requiring them to search for Docker installation guides separately.\r\n\r\n## 💡 For Reviewers\r\n\r\nThis is a documentation-only change that adds significant value for the Ubuntu user community. The commands follow Docker's official installation procedures. No code or functionality changes are involved - purely documentation enhancement to improve the onboarding experience for Ubuntu users.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Thank you for reviewing! 🙏**",
